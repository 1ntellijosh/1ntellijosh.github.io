### A 2d Space Shooter I made using JavaScript, JQuery HTML and CSS. I learned a great deal about how to use the canvas element on a web page with this.

### To win you must get through level 10, but the game will continue to go and get harder with more and more enemies. If you get 1000 points without dying, your gun upgrades and will again if you get another 1000. Run out of health, game over. Progress a level and you are granted one health bar.Arrow keys to move, and spacebar to shoot.


### Built With:

HTML  
JavaScript  
CSS  
JQuery  

### Future Goals:

_Scripted Levels  
More Enemies  
Spread Weapon Upgrades  
Volume Control  
Boss Fights  _
